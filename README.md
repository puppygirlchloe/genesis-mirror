# Genesis Mirror - Minecraft AFK Bot

## What's Genesis Mirror?

Genesis Mirror is an AFK bot for Minecraft. It helps you stay logged into servers without any issue.

## How Does it Work?

It's super easy:

1. **Connect & Reconnect**: Genesis Mirror joins your favorite Minecraft server and automatically and keeps trying if you get disconnected.

## Features
- **Reconnects Automatically**: Genesis Mirror handles server disconnects and joins back, so you don't miss stuff from a night-long afk session.

- **Web Panel**: There's a basic web panel to check what's happening on the server, but it's not complete yet.

## How to Set it Up

1. **Get it & Install**: Make sure you've got [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, download Genesis Mirror from the website.

2. **Install What it Needs**: Open your terminal and go to the folder where you put Genesis Mirror. Type this to get everything ready:

    ```bash
    npm install requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set it Up**: Open the config.json file and put in the IP address of your server. You can tweak other stuff too if you want.

4. **Start it Up**: To get the bot going, type this in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Now Genesis Mirror will handle staying online for you while you do other stuff.

## That's All!

Enjoy being AFK without worrying about getting kicked out! ðŸš€
